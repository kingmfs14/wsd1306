			<p>In each excursion whether on a relaxing sailboat ride to see the humpback whales or diving for dinner, you 
			will be treated like royalty from our well trained and experienced staff. We have a <em>wealth of knowledge</em> from 
			the locals on island that will treat you to some of the most well fished reefs for either snorkeling, scuba diving, or 
			spear fishing. Most of our staff have been in the waters of Maui for more than <strong>13 years</strong> and with experience 
			comes the knowledge it takes to show things that other can't.</p> 
			
			<p>Carry, our marine biologist, has been studying whale patterns in Maui for more than <strong>15 years</strong>. She has 
			studied the songs of the whales along with behavior patterns that guarantee a pleasant time aboard our 20 foot catamaran. 
			She also assists our kayaking crew to take the tour to the areas where whales travel the most. She makes the spectacle of
			active whales come to life with her expertise in the whale world.</p>
		
			<p>Every excursion includes assistance from several of our staff to insure that every individual in a party has been treated
			with answers to questions, guidance when needed, and assistance when asked. Each excursion comes complimentary with a snack,
			beverages, and any equipment needed like snorkels, scuba equipment, spearguns, 3-prongs and kayaks. Before being taken out on 
			both spear fishing and scuba diving excursions, individuals <em>will</em> be trained on using the equipment <em>prior</em> to 
			launch time.</p>

			<p>Maui Underwater Excursions was <strong>AMAZING!</strong> The staff took a group of us to Molokini crater on
			one of their sailboats. On the way, we saw a group of whales jumping and slapping the water. The crew allowed us
			to stop and take pictures before continuing the tour. Once we got there, we had three dive staff in the water with 
			us guiding us around the reef. I highly recommend these guys! With their kind, knowledgeable, and caring staff they
			are hard to beat on Maui!</p>
